# MeshRIR

## Description
MeshRIR is a dataset of acoustic room impulse responses (RIRs) at finely meshed grid points. Two subdatasets are currently available: one consists of IRs in a 3D cuboidal region from a single source, and the other consists of IRs in a 2D square region from an array of 32 sources. This dataset is suitable for evaluating sound field analysis and synthesis methods.
